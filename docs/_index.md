## Developer Documentation

Welcome to our developer documentation. Here you can find documentation for developers on 
- The oCIS server 
- oCIS extensions
- All Client, like Android, iOS, and the Desktop Client
- Integrations

## We love open source

The oCIS server is Apache v2 licensed.
The lower storage layer of oCIS is defined by the CS3 APIs and implemented in the REVA project. Our goal is to develop the CS3 APIs to an open standard and collaborate on the open source REVA reference implementation for CS3 APIs.

You can also find all client sources on github.

## Join us

The oCIS server repository on github is a good entrypoint for you to join the project. But we also develop clients for iOS, Android, Desktop and Web.

For communication on development you can join our public chat https://talk.owncloud.com

If you want to help and improve ownCloud, start coding or open issues on github in the related repositiory. 

We are very happy to hear your feedback and ideas!
