## Deployments scenarios and examples
This section handles deployments and operations for admins. If you are looking for a development setup, start with [Getting started](https://owncloud.github.io/ocis/getting-started/).

### Setup oCIS on your server
oCIS deployments are super simple, yet there are many configurations possible for advanced setups.

- [Basic oCIS setup]({{< ref "basic-remote-setup.md" >}}) - configure domain, certificates and port
- [oCIS setup with Traefik for ssl termination]({{< ref "ocis_traefik.md" >}})
- [oCIS setup with external OIDC IDP]({{< ref "ocis_external_idp.md" >}})

### Migrate an existing ownCloud 10
You can run ownCloud 10 and oCIS together. This allows you to use new parts of oCIS already with ownCloud 10 and also to have a smooth transition for users from ownCloud 10 to oCIS.

- ownCloud 10 with oCIS IDP
- Switch on the new front end "oCIS web" with ownCloud 10
- Run ownCloud 10 and oCIS in parallel - together
- Migrate users from ownCloud 10 to oCIS
