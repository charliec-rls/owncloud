Feature: CORS headers
  As a user
  I want to send a cross-origin request
  So that I can check if the correct headers are set

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And the config "OCIS_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS" has been set to "https://aphno.badal"

  @issue-5195
  Scenario Outline: CORS headers should be returned when setting CORS domain sending origin header
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    When user "Alice" sends HTTP method "GET" to OCS API endpoint "<endpoint>" with headers
      | header | value               |
      | Origin | https://aphno.badal |
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status-code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "<http-status-code>"
    And the following headers should be set
      | header                           | value               |
      | Access-Control-Expose-Headers    | Location            |
      | Access-Control-Allow-Origin      | https://aphno.badal |
    Examples:
      | ocs-api-version | endpoint                          | ocs-status-code | http-status-code |
      | 1               | /config                           | 100             | 200              |
      | 2               | /config                           | 200             | 200              |
      | 1               | /apps/files_sharing/api/v1/shares | 100             | 200              |
      | 2               | /apps/files_sharing/api/v1/shares | 200             | 200              |


  Scenario Outline: CORS headers should not be returned when CORS domain does not match origin header
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    When user "Alice" sends HTTP method "GET" to OCS API endpoint "<endpoint>" with headers
      | header | value              |
      | Origin | https://mero.badal |
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status-code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "<http-status-code>"
    And the following headers should not be set
      | header                        |
      | Access-Control-Allow-Headers  |
      | Access-Control-Expose-Headers |
      | Access-Control-Allow-Origin   |
      | Access-Control-Allow-Methods  |
    Examples:
      | ocs-api-version | endpoint                          | ocs-status-code | http-status-code |
      | 1               | /config                           | 100             | 200              |
      | 2               | /config                           | 200             | 200              |
      | 1               | /apps/files_sharing/api/v1/shares | 100             | 200              |
