Feature: create files and folder
  As a user
  I want to be able to create files and folders
  So that I can organise the files in my file system

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario Outline: create a folder
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" creates folder <folder-name> using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And as "Alice" folder <folder-name> should exist
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version | folder-name     |
      | old              | "upload"         |
      | old              | "strÃ¤ngÃ© folder" |
      | old              | "C++ folder.cpp" |
      | old              | "à¤¨à¥‡à¤ªà¤¾à¤²à¥€"           |
      | old              | "folder #2"      |
      | old              | "folder ?2"      |
      | old              | "ðŸ˜€ ðŸ¤–"          |
      | old              | "new&folder"     |
      | old              | "Sample,comma"   |
      | old              | "'single'"       |
