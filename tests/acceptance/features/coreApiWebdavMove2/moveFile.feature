  Scenario Outline: moving a file
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 0" to "textfile0.txt"
    When user "Alice" moves file "/textfile0.txt" to "/FOLDER/textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions for user "Alice"
      | ETag | /^"[a-f0-9:\.]{1,32}"$/ |
    And the content of file "/FOLDER/textfile0.txt" for user "Alice" should be "ownCloud test text file 0"

  Scenario Outline: moving a file from a folder to the root
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "<source_folder>"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 0" to "/<source_folder>/<source_file>"
    When user "Alice" moves file "/<source_folder>/<source_file>" to "/<target_file>" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions for user "Alice"
      | ETag | /^"[a-f0-9:\.]{1,32}"$/ |
    And the content of file "/<target_file>" for user "Alice" should be "ownCloud test text file 0"

  Scenario Outline: move a file of size zero byte
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/zerobyte.txt" to "/zerobyte.txt"
