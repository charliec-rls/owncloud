Feature: users cannot move (rename) a file to a blacklisted name
  As an administrator
  I want to be able to prevent users from moving (renaming) files to specified file names
  So that I can prevent unwanted file names existing in the cloud storage

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 0" to "textfile0.txt"

  @issue-1295
  Scenario Outline: rename a file to a filename that is banned by default
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" moves file "/textfile0.txt" to "/.htaccess" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |

    @skipOnRevaMaster
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | spaces           |
