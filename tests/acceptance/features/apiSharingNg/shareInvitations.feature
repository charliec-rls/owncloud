Feature: Send a sharing invitations
  As the owner of a resource
  I want to be able to send invitations to other users
  So that they can have access to it

  https://owncloud.dev/libre-graph-api/#/drives.permissions/Invite

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |


  Scenario Outline: send share invitation to user with different roles
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "to share" to "/textfile1.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "FolderToShare"
    When user "Alice" sends the following share invitation using the Graph API:
      | resourceType    | <resource-type>    |
      | resource        | <path>             |

      | shareType       | user               |
      | permissionsRole | <permissions-role> |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And for user "Brian" the space Shares should contain these entries:
      | <path> |
    And the JSON data of the response should match
