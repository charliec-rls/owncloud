  https://owncloud.dev/libre-graph-api/#/drives.permissions/DeletePermission

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And using spaces DAV path


  Scenario Outline: user removes access to resource in the user share
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "FolderToShare"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "textfile.txt"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following share invitation:
      | resource        | <resource>         |
      | space           | Personal           |
      | sharee          | Brian              |
      | shareType       | user               |
      | permissionsRole | <permissions-role> |
    When user "Alice" removes the share permission of user "Brian" from resource "<resource>" of space "Personal" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And for user "Brian" the space "Shares" should not contain these entries:
      | <resource> |
    Examples:
      | permissions-role | resource      |
      | Viewer           | textfile.txt  |

    And user "Alice" has created a folder "FolderToShare" in space "NewSpace"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "NewSpace" with content "some content" to "textfile.txt"
