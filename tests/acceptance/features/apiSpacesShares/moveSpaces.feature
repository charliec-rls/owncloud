Feature: move (rename) file
  As a user
  I want to be able to move and rename files
  So that I can manage my file system

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And using spaces DAV path


  Scenario Outline: moving a file within same space project with role manager and editor
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Brian" using the Graph API
    And user "Brian" has created a space "Project" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Brian" has created a folder "newfolder" in space "Project"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded a file inside space "Project" with content "some content" to "insideSpace.txt"
    And user "Brian" has shared a space "Project" with settings:
      | shareWith | Alice  |
      | role      | <role> |
    When user "Alice" moves file "insideSpace.txt" to "newfolder/insideSpace.txt" in space "Project" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And for user "Alice" folder "newfolder" of the space "Project" should contain these entries:
      | insideSpace.txt |
    But for user "Alice" the space "Project" should not contain these entries:
      | insideSpace.txt |
    Examples:
      | role    |
      | manager |
      | editor  |


  Scenario: moving a file within same space project with role viewer
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Brian" using the Graph API
    And user "Brian" has created a space "Project" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Brian" has created a folder "newfolder" in space "Project"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded a file inside space "Project" with content "some content" to "insideSpace.txt"
    And user "Brian" has shared a space "Project" with settings:
      | shareWith | Alice  |
      | role      | viewer |
    When user "Alice" moves file "insideSpace.txt" to "newfolder/insideSpace.txt" in space "Project" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And for user "Alice" folder "newfolder" of the space "Project" should not contain these entries:
      | insideSpace.txt |
    But for user "Alice" the space "Project" should contain these entries:
      | insideSpace.txt |

    And user "Brian" has shared a space "Project1" with settings:
      | shareWith | Alice       |
      | role      | <from_role> |
    When user "Alice" moves file "project1.txt" from space "Project1" to "project1.txt" inside space "Project2" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "<https_status_code>"
    And for user "Alice" the space "Project1" should contain these entries:
      | project1.txt |
    And for user "Alice" the space "Project2" should not contain these entries:
      | project1.txt |
