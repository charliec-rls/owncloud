Feature: sharing
  As a user
  I want to share resources with different permissions
  So that I can manage the access to the resource

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And using spaces DAV path
