Feature: Share spaces via link
  As the manager of a space
  I want to be able to share a space via public link
  So that an anonymous user can have access to certain resources

  Note - this feature is run in CI with ACCOUNTS_HASH_DIFFICULTY set to the default for production
  See https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1542 and https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/839

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And using spaces DAV path
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "share space" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "share space" with content "some content" to "test.txt"


  Scenario Outline: manager can share a space to public via link with different permissions
    When user "Alice" creates a public link share of the space "share space" with settings:
      | permissions | <permissions> |
      | password    | <password>    |
      | name        | <linkName>    |
      | expireDate  | <expireDate>  |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the OCS status code should be "200"
    And the OCS status message should be "OK"
    And the fields of the last response to user "Alice" should include
      | item_type         | folder                |
      | mimetype          | httpd/unix-directory  |
      | file_target       | /                     |
      | path              | /                     |
      | permissions       | <expectedPermissions> |
      | share_type        | public_link           |
      | displayname_owner | %displayname%         |
      | uid_owner         | %username%            |
      | name              | <linkName>            |
    When the public downloads file "/test.txt" from inside the last public link shared folder with password "<password>" using the new public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the downloaded content should be "some content"
    But the public should not be able to download file "/test.txt" from inside the last public link shared folder using the new public WebDAV API with password "wrong pass"
    Examples:
      | permissions | expectedPermissions       | password | linkName | expireDate               |
      | 1           | read                      | %public% | link     | 2042-03-25T23:59:59+0100 |
      | 5           | read,create               | %public% |          | 2042-03-25T23:59:59+0100 |
      | 15          | read,update,create,delete | %public% | link     |                          |


  Scenario: manager can create internal link without password
    When user "Alice" creates a public link share of the space "share space" with settings:
      | permissions | 0 |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the OCS status code should be "200"
    And the OCS status message should be "OK"
    And the fields of the last response to user "Alice" should include
      | permissions | 0           |
      | share_type  | public_link |


  Scenario: uploader should be able to upload a file
    When user "Alice" creates a public link share of the space "share space" with settings:
      | permissions | 4                        |
      | password    | %public%                 |
      | name        | forUpload                |
      | expireDate  | 2042-03-25T23:59:59+0100 |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the OCS status code should be "200"
    And the OCS status message should be "OK"
    And the fields of the last response to user "Alice" should include
      | item_type         | folder               |
      | mimetype          | httpd/unix-directory |
      | file_target       | /                    |
      | path              | /                    |
      | permissions       | create               |
      | share_type        | public_link          |
      | displayname_owner | %displayname%        |
      | uid_owner         | %username%           |
      | name              | forUpload            |
    And the public should be able to upload file "lorem.txt" into the last public link shared folder using the new public WebDAV API with password "%public%"
    And for user "Alice" the space "share space" should contain these entries:
      | lorem.txt |
