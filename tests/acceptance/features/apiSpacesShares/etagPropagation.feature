Feature: check etag propagation after different file alterations

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And using spaces DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/upload"

    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/upload" with user "Brian"
    And user "Brian" has accepted share "/upload" offered by user "Alice"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/" inside space "Personal"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/upload" inside space "Personal"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/upload/sub" inside space "Personal"
    And user "Brian" has stored etag of element "/" inside space "Personal"
    And user "Brian" has stored etag of element "/" inside space "Shares Jail"
    And user "Brian" has stored etag of element "/upload" inside space "Shares Jail"
    And user "Brian" has stored etag of element "/upload/sub" inside space "Shares Jail"
    When user "Brian" removes the file "upload/sub/toDelete" from space "Shares Jail"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And these etags should have changed
      | user  | path        | space       |
      | Alice | /           | Personal    |
      | Alice | /upload     | Personal    |
      | Alice | /upload/sub | Personal    |
      | Brian | /           | Shares Jail |
      | Brian | /upload     | Shares Jail |
      | Brian | /upload/sub | Shares Jail |
    And these etags should not have changed
      | user  | path | space    |
      | Brian | /    | Personal |


  Scenario: As sharer deleting (removing) a folder changes the etags of all parents for all collaborators
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "/upload/sub"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/upload/sub/toDelete"
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/upload" with user "Brian"
    And user "Brian" has accepted share "/upload" offered by user "Alice"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/" inside space "Personal"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/upload" inside space "Personal"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/upload/sub" inside space "Personal"
    And user "Brian" has stored etag of element "/" inside space "Personal"
    And user "Brian" has stored etag of element "/" inside space "Shares Jail"
    And user "Brian" has stored etag of element "/upload" inside space "Shares Jail"
    And user "Brian" has stored etag of element "/upload/sub" inside space "Shares Jail"
    When user "Alice" removes the file "upload/sub/toDelete" from space "Personal"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And these etags should have changed
      | user  | path        | space       |
      | Alice | /           | Personal    |
      | Alice | /upload     | Personal    |
      | Alice | /upload/sub | Personal    |
      | Brian | /           | Shares Jail |
      | Brian | /upload     | Shares Jail |
      | Brian | /upload/sub | Shares Jail |
    And these etags should not have changed
      | user  | path | space    |
      | Brian | /    | Personal |
