Feature: antivirus
  As a system administrator and user
  I want to protect myself and others from known viruses
  So that I can prevent files with viruses from being uploaded


  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario Outline: upload a normal file without virus
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/normalfile.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And as "Alice" file "/normalfile.txt" should exist
    And the content of file "/normalfile.txt" for user "Alice" should be:
    """
    This is a testfile.

    Cheers.
