Feature: Search
  As a user
  I want to search for resources in the space
  So that I can get them quickly

  Note - this feature is run in CI with ACCOUNTS_HASH_DIFFICULTY set to the default for production
  See https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1542 and https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/839

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And using spaces DAV path
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "find data" with the default quota using the GraphApi
    And user "Alice" has created a folder "folderMain/SubFolder1/subFOLDER2" in space "find data"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "find data" with content "some content" to "folderMain/SubFolder1/subFOLDER2/insideTheFolder.txt"


  Scenario Outline: user can find data from the project space
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" searches for "*fol*" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the search result should contain "4" entries
    And the search result of user "Alice" should contain these entries:
      | /folderMain                                           |
      | /folderMain/SubFolder1                                |
      | /folderMain/SubFolder1/subFOLDER2                     |
      | /folderMain/SubFolder1/subFOLDER2/insideTheFolder.txt |
    Examples:

    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the search result should contain "2" entries
    And the search result of user "Alice" should contain these entries:

      | /folderMain/SubFolder1/subFOLDER2 |
    But the search result of user "Alice" should not contain these entries:

      | role      | viewer     |
    When user "Brian" searches for "*folder*" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the search result should contain "4" entries
