Feature: file versions remember the author of each version
  As a user
  I want to know the author of each version of a file
  So that I can better understand the version history and choose a version to restore

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "2"
    And using new DAV path
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Carol" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario: enable file versioning and check the history of changes from multiple users
    Given user "David" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/test"
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/test" with user "Brian" with permissions "all"
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/test" with user "Carol" with permissions "all"
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/test" with user "David" with permissions "all"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content alice" to "/test/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content brian" to "/Shares/test/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Carol" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content carol" to "/Shares/test/textfile0.txt"
    And user "David" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content david" to "/Shares/test/textfile0.txt"
    When user "Alice" gets the number of versions of file "/test/textfile0.txt"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the number of versions should be "3"
    And the content of version index "1" of file "/test/textfile0.txt" for user "Alice" should be "uploaded content carol"
    And the content of version index "2" of file "/test/textfile0.txt" for user "Alice" should be "uploaded content brian"
    And the content of version index "3" of file "/test/textfile0.txt" for user "Alice" should be "uploaded content alice"
    And as users "Alice" the authors of the versions of file "/test/textfile0.txt" should be:
      | index | author |
      | 1     | Carol  |
      | 2     | Brian  |
      | 3     | Alice  |
    And as users "Brian,Carol,David" the authors of the versions of file "/Shares/test/textfile0.txt" should be:
      | index | author |
      | 1     | Carol  |
      | 2     | Brian  |
      | 3     | Alice  |

    And user "Brian" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content brian" to "/Shares/test/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Carol" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content carol" to "/Shares/test/textfile0.txt"
    When user "Alice" gets the number of versions of file "/test/textfile0.txt"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the number of versions should be "2"
    And the content of version index "1" of file "/test/textfile0.txt" for user "Alice" should be "uploaded content brian"
    And the content of version index "2" of file "/test/textfile0.txt" for user "Alice" should be "uploaded content alice"
