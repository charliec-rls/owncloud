Feature: moving/renaming file using file id
  As a user
  I want to be able to move or rename files using file id
  So that I can manage my file system

  Background:
    Given using spaces DAV path
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario Outline: move a file into a folder inside personal space
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "/folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" moves a file "/textfile.txt" into "/folder" inside space "Personal" using file-id path "<dav-path>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And for user "Alice" folder "folder" of the space "Personal" should contain these files:
      | textfile.txt |
    But for user "Alice" the space "Personal" should not contain these entries:
      | textfile.txt |
    Examples:
      | dav-path                          |
      | /remote.php/dav/spaces/<<FILEID>> |
      | /dav/spaces/<<FILEID>>            |


  Scenario Outline: move a file into a sub-folder inside personal space
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "/folder"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "folder/sub-folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" moves a file "/textfile.txt" into "/folder/sub-folder" inside space "Personal" using file-id path "<dav-path>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And for user "Alice" folder "folder/sub-folder/" of the space "Personal" should contain these files:
      | textfile.txt |
    But for user "Alice" the space "Personal" should not contain these entries:
      | textfile.txt |
    Examples:
      | dav-path                          |
      | /remote.php/dav/spaces/<<FILEID>> |
      | /dav/spaces/<<FILEID>>            |


  Scenario Outline: move a file from folder to root inside personal space
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "/folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "folder/textfile.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" moves a file "folder/textfile.txt" into "/" inside space "Personal" using file-id path "<dav-path>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And for user "Alice" the space "Personal" should contain these entries:
      | textfile.txt |
    But for user "Alice" folder "folder" of the space "Personal" should not contain these files:
      | textfile.txt |
    Examples:
      | dav-path                          |
      | /remote.php/dav/spaces/<<FILEID>> |
      | /dav/spaces/<<FILEID>>            |


  Scenario Outline: move a file from sub-folder to root inside personal space

    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" moves a file "folder/sub-folder/textfile.txt" into "/" inside space "Personal" using file-id path "<dav-path>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And for user "Alice" the space "Personal" should contain these entries:
      | textfile.txt |
    But for user "Alice" folder "folder/sub-folder" of the space "Personal" should not contain these files:

      | /remote.php/dav/spaces/<<FILEID>> |
      | /dav/spaces/<<FILEID>>            |


  Scenario Outline: move a file into a folder inside project space
    Given using spaces DAV path
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "project-space" with the default quota using the GraphApi
    And user "Alice" has created a folder "/folder" in space "project-space"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "project-space" with content "some data" to "textfile.txt"
