Feature: copying file using file id
  As a user
  I want to copy the file using file id
  So that I can manage my resource

  Background:
    Given using spaces DAV path
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario Outline: copy a file into a folder in personal space
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "/folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" copies a file "/textfile.txt" into "/folder" inside space "Personal" using file-id path "<dav-path>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And for user "Alice" the space "Personal" should contain these entries:
      | folder/textfile.txt |
      | textfile.txt        |
    Examples:
      | dav-path                          |
      | /remote.php/dav/spaces/<<FILEID>> |
      | /dav/spaces/<<FILEID>>            |


  Scenario Outline: copy a file into a sub-folder in personal space
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "/folder"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "folder/sub-folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" copies a file "/textfile.txt" into "/folder/sub-folder" inside space "Personal" using file-id path "<dav-path>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And for user "Alice" the space "Personal" should contain these entries:
      | folder/sub-folder/textfile.txt |
      | textfile.txt                   |
    Examples:
      | dav-path                          |
      | /remote.php/dav/spaces/<<FILEID>> |
      | /dav/spaces/<<FILEID>>            |


  Scenario Outline: copy a file from a folder into root of personal space
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "/folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "folder/textfile.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" copies a file "folder/textfile.txt" into "/" inside space "Personal" using file-id path "<dav-path>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And for user "Alice" the space "Personal" should contain these entries:
      | textfile.txt        |
      | folder/textfile.txt |
    Examples:
      | dav-path                          |
      | /remote.php/dav/spaces/<<FILEID>> |
      | /dav/spaces/<<FILEID>>            |


  Scenario Outline: copy a file from sub-folder into root of personal space
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "/folder"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "folder/sub-folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "folder/sub-folder/textfile.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" copies a file "folder/sub-folder/textfile.txt" into "/" inside space "Personal" using file-id path "<dav-path>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And for user "Alice" the space "Personal" should contain these entries:
      | textfile.txt                   |
      | folder/sub-folder/textfile.txt |
    Examples:
      | dav-path                          |
      | /remote.php/dav/spaces/<<FILEID>> |
      | /dav/spaces/<<FILEID>>            |
