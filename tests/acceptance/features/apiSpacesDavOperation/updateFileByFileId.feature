Feature: update files using file id
  As a user
  I want to update the files using file id
  So that I can make changes on the content of a file

  Background:

    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" sends HTTP method "PUT" to URL "<dav-path>" with content "updated content"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And for user "Alice" the content of the file "/textfile.txt" of the space "Personal" should be "updated content"
    Examples:
      | dav-path                          |
