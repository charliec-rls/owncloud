Feature: an user shares resources using ScienceMesh application
  As a user
  I want to share resources between different ocis instances

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes
    And using server "REMOTE"
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes

  Scenario Outline: local user shares resources to federation user
    Given using server "LOCAL"
    And "Alice" has created the federation share invitation
    And using server "REMOTE"
    And "Brian" has accepted invitation
    And using server "LOCAL"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "folderToShare"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ocm test" to "/textfile.txt"
    When user "Alice" sends the following resource share invitation to federated user using the Graph API:
      | resource        | <resource> |
      | space           | Personal   |

      | shareType       | user       |
      | permissionsRole | Viewer     |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    When using server "REMOTE"
    And user "Brian" lists the shares shared with him without retry using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the JSON data of the response should match

    And using server "REMOTE"
    And for user "Brian" the content of file "textfile.txt" of federated share "textfile.txt" should be "ocm test"
    When user "Brian" updates the content of federated share "textfile.txt" with "this is a new content" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And for user "Brian" the content of file "textfile.txt" of federated share "textfile.txt" should be "this is a new content"
    And using server "LOCAL"
    And for user "Alice" the content of the file "textfile.txt" of the space "Personal" should be "this is a new content"
