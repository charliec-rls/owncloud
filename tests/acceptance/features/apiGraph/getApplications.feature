  I want to be able to get applications information with existings roles

    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the user retrieve API response should contain the following applications information:
      | key                        | value                   |
      | displayName                | ownCloud Infinite Scale |
      | id                         | %uuid_v4%               |
    And the user retrieve API response should contain the following app roles:
      | Admin       |
      | Space Admin |
      | User        |
      | Guest       |
