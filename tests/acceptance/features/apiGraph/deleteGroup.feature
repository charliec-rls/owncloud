Feature: delete groups
  As an admin
  I want to be able to delete groups
  So that I can remove unnecessary groups

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And the administrator has given "Alice" the role "Admin" using the settings api


  Scenario Outline: admin user deletes a group
    Given group "<group_id>" has been created
    When user "Alice" deletes group "<group_id>" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And group "<group_id>" should not exist
    Examples:
      | group_id            | comment                               |
      | simplegroup         | nothing special here                  |
      | Espa√±a¬ß√†√¥≈ì‚Ç¨         | special European and other characters |
      | ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä                | Unicode group name                    |
      | brand-new-group     | dash                                  |
      | the.group           | dot                                   |
      | left,right          | comma                                 |
