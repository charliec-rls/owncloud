  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario Outline: the admin user deletes a user
    Given the administrator has given "Alice" the role "Admin" using the settings api
    And the user "Alice" has created a new user using the Graph API with the following settings:
      | userName    | <userName>    |
      | displayName | <displayName> |
      | email       | <email>       |
      | password    | <password>    |
    When the user "Alice" deletes a user "<userName>" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And user "<userName>" should not exist
    Examples:
      | userName             | displayName     | email               | password                     |

      | withoutPassSameEmail | without pass    | alice@example.org   |                              |
      | name                 | pass with space | example@example.org | my pass                      |


  Scenario: Delete a user and specify the user name in different case

    And the administrator has given "Alice" the role "Admin" using the settings api
    When the user "Alice" deletes a user "Brand-New-User" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And user "brand-new-user" should not exist


  Scenario Outline: the admin user deletes another user with different role
    Given user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And the administrator has given "Alice" the role "Admin" using the settings api
    And the administrator has given "Brian" the role "<role>" using the settings api
    When the user "Alice" deletes a user "Brian" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And user "Brian" should not exist

    Given the administrator has given "Alice" the role "Admin" using the settings api
    When the user "Alice" deletes a user "Alice" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And user "Alice" should exist


  Scenario: the admin user tries to delete a non-existent user
    Given the administrator has given "Alice" the role "Admin" using the settings api
    When the user "Alice" deletes a user "nonExistentUser" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "404"


  Scenario Outline: Non-admin user tries to delete another user with different role
    Given user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And the administrator has given "Alice" the role "<role>" using the settings api
    When the user "Alice" deletes a user "Brian" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "401"
