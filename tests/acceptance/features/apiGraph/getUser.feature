Feature: get users
  As an admin
  I want to be able to retrieve user information
  So that I can see the information

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And the administrator has given "Alice" the role "Admin" using the settings api


  Scenario: admin user gets the information of a user
    When user "Alice" gets information of user "Brian" using Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the user retrieve API response should contain the following information:
      | displayName  | id        | mail              | onPremisesSamAccountName |
      | Brian Murphy | %uuid_v4% | brian@example.org | Brian                    |


  Scenario: non-admin user tries to get the information of a user
    When user "Brian" tries to get information of user "Alice" using Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "401"
    And the last response should be an unauthorized response


  Scenario: admin user gets all users
    When user "Alice" gets all users using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
