Feature: add users to group
  As a admin
  I want to be able to add users to a group
  So that I can give a user access to the resources of the group

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario: adding a user to a group
    Given these groups have been created:
      | groupname   | comment                               |
      | simplegroup | nothing special here                  |
      | Espa√±a¬ß√†√¥≈ì‚Ç¨ | special European and other characters |
      | ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä        | Unicode group name                    |
