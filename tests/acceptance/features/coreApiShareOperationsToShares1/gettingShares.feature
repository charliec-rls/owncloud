  As a user
  I want to get all the shares
  So that I can know I have proper access to them

      | Brian    |

  Scenario Outline: getting all shares from a user
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/file_to_share.txt"
    And user "Alice" has shared file "file_to_share.txt" with user "Brian"
    When user "Alice" gets all shares shared by her using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And file "/Shares/file_to_share.txt" should be included in the response
    Examples:
      | ocs_api_version | ocs_status_code |
      | 1               | 100             |
      | 2               | 200             |
