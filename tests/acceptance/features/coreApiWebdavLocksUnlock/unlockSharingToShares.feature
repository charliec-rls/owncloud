Feature: UNLOCK locked items (sharing)
  As a user
  I want to unlock a shared resource that has been locked by me to be restricted
  So that other users cannot unlock the shared resource

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Alice" has created folder "PARENT"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "PARENT/parent.txt"


  Scenario Outline: unlocking a shared file that has been locked by the file owner is not feasible unless the owner lock tocken is used
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has locked file "PARENT/parent.txt" setting the following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    And user "Alice" has shared file "PARENT/parent.txt" with user "Brian"
    And user "Brian" has accepted share "/parent.txt" offered by user "Alice"
    When user "Brian" unlocks file "Shares/parent.txt" with the last created lock of file "PARENT/parent.txt" of user "Alice" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And 1 locks should be reported for file "PARENT/parent.txt" of user "Alice" by the WebDAV API
    And 1 locks should be reported for file "Shares/parent.txt" of user "Brian" by the WebDAV API
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version | lock-scope |
      | old              | shared     |
      | old              | exclusive  |
      | new              | shared     |
      | new              | exclusive  |

    @skipOnRevaMaster
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version | lock-scope |
      | spaces           | shared     |
      | spaces           | exclusive  |


  Scenario Outline: sharee cannot unlock a file within a shared folder when it is locked by the file owner unless the owner lock token is used
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has locked file "PARENT/parent.txt" setting the following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "PARENT" with user "Brian"
    And user "Brian" has accepted share "/PARENT" offered by user "Alice"
    When user "Brian" unlocks file "Shares/PARENT/parent.txt" with the last created lock of file "PARENT/parent.txt" of user "Alice" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And 1 locks should be reported for file "PARENT/parent.txt" of user "Alice" by the WebDAV API
    And 1 locks should be reported for file "Shares/PARENT/parent.txt" of user "Brian" by the WebDAV API
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version | lock-scope |
      | old              | shared     |
      | old              | exclusive  |
      | new              | shared     |
      | new              | exclusive  |

      | spaces           | exclusive  |


  Scenario Outline: sharee unlock a shared file
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has shared file "PARENT/parent.txt" with user "Brian"
    And user "Brian" has accepted share "/parent.txt" offered by user "Alice"
    And user "Brian" has locked file "Shares/parent.txt" setting the following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    When user "Brian" unlocks the last created lock of file "Shares/parent.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And 0 locks should be reported for file "PARENT/parent.txt" of user "Alice" by the WebDAV API
    And 0 locks should be reported for file "Shares/parent.txt" of user "Brian" by the WebDAV API
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version | lock-scope |
      | old              | shared     |
      | old              | exclusive  |

  Scenario Outline: as owner unlocking a shared file locked by the receiver is not possible. To unlock use the receivers locktoken
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has shared file "PARENT/parent.txt" with user "Brian"

      | dav-path-version | lock-scope |
      | old              | shared     |

  Scenario Outline: unlocking a file in a shared folder, which was locked by the sharee is not possible for the owner unless the receiver's locktoken is used

    And user "Alice" has shared folder "PARENT" with user "Brian"
    And user "Brian" has accepted share "/PARENT" offered by user "Alice"
    And user "Brian" has locked file "Shares/PARENT/parent.txt" setting the following properties
