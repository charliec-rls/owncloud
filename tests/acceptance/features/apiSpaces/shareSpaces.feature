Feature: Share spaces
  As the owner of a space
  I want to be able to add members to a space, and to remove access for them

  Note - this feature is run in CI with ACCOUNTS_HASH_DIFFICULTY set to the default for production
  See https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1542 and https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/839

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Bob      |
    And the administrator has given "Alice" the role "Space Admin" using the settings api
    And user "Alice" has created a space "share space" with the default quota using the GraphApi


  Scenario Outline:: A user can share a space to another user
    When user "Alice" shares a space "share space" to user "Brian" with role "<role>"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the OCS status code should be "200"
    And the OCS status message should be "OK"
    When user "Brian" lists all available spaces via the GraphApi
    Then the json responded should contain a space "share space" with these key and value pairs:
      | key       | value       |
      | driveType | project     |
      | id        | %space_id%  |
      | name      | share space |
    Examples:
      | role    |
      | manager |
      | editor  |
      | viewer  |


  Scenario: A user can see who has been granted access
    Given user "Alice" has shared a space "share space" to user "Brian" with role "viewer"
    When user "Alice" lists all available spaces via the GraphApi
    Then the json responded should contain a space "share space" granted to "Brian" with these key and value pairs:
      | key                                                | value     |
      | root@@@permissions@@@1@@@grantedTo@@@0@@@user@@@id | %user_id% |
      | root@@@permissions@@@1@@@roles@@@0                 | viewer    |


  Scenario: A user can see a file in a received shared space
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "share space" with content "Test" to "test.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created a folder "Folder Main" in space "share space"
    When user "Alice" shares a space "share space" to user "Brian" with role "viewer"
    Then for user "Brian" the space "share space" should contain these entries:
      | test.txt    |
      | Folder Main |


  Scenario: When a user unshares a space, the space becomes unavailable to the receiver
    Given user "Alice" has shared a space "share space" to user "Brian" with role "viewer"
    When user "Brian" lists all available spaces via the GraphApi
    Then the json responded should contain a space "share space" with these key and value pairs:
      | key       | value       |
      | driveType | project     |
      | id        | %space_id%  |
      | name      | share space |
    When user "Alice" unshares a space "share space" to user "Brian"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And user "Brian" lists all available spaces via the GraphApi
    And the json responded should not contain a space with name "share space"


  Scenario: A user can add another user to the space managers to enable him
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "share space" with content "Test" to "test.txt"
    And user "Alice" has shared a space "share space" to user "Brian" with role "manager"
    When user "Brian" lists all available spaces via the GraphApi
    Then the json responded should contain a space "share space" granted to "Brian" with role "manager"
    When user "Brian" has shared a space "share space" to user "Bob" with role "viewer"
    And user "Bob" lists all available spaces via the GraphApi
    Then the json responded should contain a space "share space" granted to "Bob" with role "viewer"
    And for user "Bob" the space "share space" should contain these entries:
      | test.txt |
