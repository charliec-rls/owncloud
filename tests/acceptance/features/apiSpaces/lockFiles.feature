Feature: lock files
  As a user
  I want to lock files

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |


  Scenario Outline: lock a file
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "Alice Hansen" with content "some content" to "textfile.txt"
    When user "Alice" locks file "textfile.txt" using the WebDAV API setting the following properties
      | lockscope | exclusive |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    When user "Alice" sends PROPFIND request from the space "Alice Hansen" to the resource "textfile.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the "PROPFIND" response to user "Alice" should contain a space "Alice Hansen" with these key and value pairs:
      | key                                                  | value        |
      | d:lockdiscovery/d:activelock/d:lockscope/d:exclusive |              |
      | d:lockdiscovery/d:activelock/d:depth                 | Infinity     |
      | d:lockdiscovery/d:activelock/d:timeout               | Infinity     |
      | d:lockdiscovery/d:activelock/oc:ownername            | Alice Hansen |
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |


  Scenario Outline: lock a file with a timeout
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "Alice Hansen" with content "some content" to "textfile.txt"
    When user "Alice" locks file "textfile.txt" using the WebDAV API setting the following properties
      | lockscope | exclusive   |
      | timeout   | Second-5000 |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    When user "Alice" sends PROPFIND request from the space "Alice Hansen" to the resource "textfile.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the "PROPFIND" response to user "Alice" should contain a space "Alice Hansen" with these key and value pairs:
      | key                                                  | value        |
      | d:lockdiscovery/d:activelock/d:lockscope/d:exclusive |              |
      | d:lockdiscovery/d:activelock/d:depth                 | Infinity     |
      | d:lockdiscovery/d:activelock/d:timeout               | Second-5000  |
      | d:lockdiscovery/d:activelock/oc:ownername            | Alice Hansen |
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |


  Scenario Outline: lock a file using file-id
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "Alice Hansen" with content "some content" to "textfile.txt"
    And we save it into "FILEID"
    When user "Alice" locks file using file-id path "<dav-path>" using the WebDAV API setting the following properties
      | lockscope | exclusive   |
      | timeout   | Second-3600 |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    When user "Alice" sends PROPFIND request from the space "Alice Hansen" to the resource "textfile.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the "PROPFIND" response to user "Alice" should contain a space "Alice Hansen" with these key and value pairs:
      | key                                                  | value        |
      | d:lockdiscovery/d:activelock/d:lockscope/d:exclusive |              |
      | d:lockdiscovery/d:activelock/d:depth                 | Infinity     |
      | d:lockdiscovery/d:activelock/d:timeout               | Second-3600  |
      | d:lockdiscovery/d:activelock/oc:ownername            | Alice Hansen |
    Examples:
      | dav-path                          |
      | /remote.php/dav/spaces/<<FILEID>> |
      | /dav/spaces/<<FILEID>>            |


  Scenario Outline: user cannot lock file twice
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "Alice Hansen" with content "some content" to "textfile.txt"
    And user "Alice" has locked file "textfile.txt" setting the following properties
      | lockscope | exclusive |
    When user "Alice" tries to lock file "textfile.txt" using the WebDAV API setting the following properties
      | lockscope | exclusive |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "423"
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
      | spaces           |

    And using spaces DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created a space "Project" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "Project" with content "some content" to "textfile.txt"
