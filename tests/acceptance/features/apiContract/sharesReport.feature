Feature: REPORT request to Shares space
  As a user
  I want to check the share REPORT response
  So that I can make sure that the response contains all the relevant details for shares

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/folderMain"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/folderMain/SubFolder1"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/folderMain/SubFolder1/subFOLDER2"
    And user "Alice" has shared entry "/folderMain" with user "Brian" with permissions "17"


  Scenario Outline: check the REPORT response of the found folder
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Brian" has accepted share "/folderMain" offered by user "Alice"
    When user "Brian" searches for "SubFolder1" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions
      | X-Request-Id                | /^[a-f0-9!\-]{36}$/    |
    And the "REPORT" response to user "Brian" should contain a mountpoint "folderMain" with these key and value pairs:
      | key              | value                |
      | oc:fileid        | UUIDof:SubFolder1    |
      | oc:file-parent   | UUIDof:folderMain    |
      | oc:shareroot     | /folderMain          |
      | oc:name          | SubFolder1           |
      | d:getcontenttype | httpd/unix-directory |
      | oc:permissions   | S                    |
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |


  Scenario Outline: check the REPORT response of the found file
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Brian" has accepted share "/folderMain" offered by user "Alice"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "Not all those who wander are lost." to "/folderMain/SubFolder1/subFOLDER2/frodo.txt"
    When user "Brian" searches for "frodo.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions
      | X-Request-Id                | /^[a-f0-9!\-]{36}$/    |
    And the "REPORT" response to user "Brian" should contain a mountpoint "folderMain" with these key and value pairs:
      | key                | value                                  |
      | oc:fileid          | UUIDof:SubFolder1/subFOLDER2/frodo.txt |
      | oc:file-parent     | UUIDof:SubFolder1/subFOLDER2           |
      | oc:shareroot       | /folderMain                            |
      | oc:name            | frodo.txt                              |
      | d:getcontenttype   | text/plain                             |
      | oc:permissions     | S                                      |
      | d:getcontentlength | 34                                     |
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |


  Scenario Outline: search for the shared folder when share is not accepted
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Brian" searches for "folderMain" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions
      | X-Request-Id                | /^[a-f0-9!\-]{36}$/    |
    And the search result should contain "0" entries
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |
