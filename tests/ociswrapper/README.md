## oCIS Wrapper

A tool that wraps the oCIS binary and provides a way to re-configure the running oCIS instance.

When run, **ociswrapper** starts an API server that exposes some endpoints to re-configure the oCIS server.

### Usage

1. Build

   ```bash
   make build
   ```

2. Run

   ```bash
   ./bin/ociswrapper serve --bin=<path-to-ocis-binary>
   ```

Access the API server at `http://localhost:5000`.

Also, see `./bin/ociswrapper help` for more information.

### API

**ociswrapper** exposes two endpoints:

1. `PUT /config`

   Updates the configuration of the running oCIS instance.
   Body of the request should be a JSON object with the following structure:

   ```json
   {
     "ENV_KEY1": "value1",
     "ENV_KEY2": "value2"
   }
   ```

   Returns:

   - `200 OK` - oCIS is successfully reconfigured
   - `400 Bad Request` - request body is not a valid JSON object
   - `500 Internal Server Error` - oCIS server is not running

2. `DELETE /rollback`

   Rolls back the configuration to the starting point.

   Returns:

   - `200 OK` - rollback is successful
   - `500 Internal Server Error` - oCIS server is not running
