**This project is under heavy development, it's not in a working state yet!**

## Install

You can download prebuilt binaries from the GitHub releases or from our [download mirrors](http://download.owncloud.com/ocis/ocis/). For instructions how to install this on your platform you should take a look at our [documentation](https://owncloud.github.io/ocis/)

## Development

Make sure you have a working Go environment, for further reference or a guide take a look at the [install instructions](http://golang.org/doc/install.html). This project requires Go >= v1.13.

```console
git clone https://github.com/owncloud/ocis.git
cd ocis

make generate build

./bin/ocis -h
```

## Prerequisites

### Redis server

You will need to start a redis server as a cache. The ownCloud storage driver currently will try to connect to the default port.

### Root storage

To prepare the root storage you should fill it with two folders. They are necessary for resolving the home and ownCloud storages. This is subject to change.

```console
mkdir -p /var/tmp/reva/root/{home,oc}
```

## Quickstart

After building the binary with the above steps and also setting up the prerequisites, run this command to start all services:

```console
./bin/ocis server
```

Open [http://localhost:9100](http://localhost:9100) and login using one of the demo accounts:

```console
albert:relativity
marie:radioactivty
richard:superfluidity
```
